# Tetris
An (imperfect) implementation of Tetris.

## How to Play
Start the game by running the executable file Tetris.jar. <br \> <br \>

Use the `left` and `right` arrow keys to move a Tetris piece across the game window. Use the `up` arrow key to rotate a Tetris piece. Use the `down` arrow key to speed up a Tetris piece's descent. Press `space` to drop the Tetris piece immediately down into place.
