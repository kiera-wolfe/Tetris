# Tetris
An (imperfect) implementation of Tetris.

## How to Play
Start the game by running the executable file Tetris.jar. Use the `left` and `right` arrow keys to move a Tetris piece across the game window. Use the up arrow key to rotate a Tetris piece. Use the down arrow key to speed up a Tetris piece's descent. Press the space bar to drop the Tetris piece immediately down into place.
